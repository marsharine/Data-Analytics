### **Project Scope: Data Breach Analysis Dashboard**

#### **Project Overview**

**Name:** Data Breach Analysis Dashboard

**Objective:** To create interactive dashboards that analyze data breach incidents, providing insights into breach patterns, response effectiveness, and potential vulnerabilities. The goal is to help organizations understand the causes and impacts of breaches, and to enhance their security posture.

#### **Key Features**

1. **Incident Overview:**  
   * **Incident Details:** Display data on breach incidents including date, type of breach (e.g., ransomware, phishing), and affected sectors.  
   * **Frequency and Trends:** Visualize the frequency of breaches over time to identify any increasing trends or patterns.  
2. **Breach Characteristics:**  
   * **Attack Vectors:** Analyze common attack vectors (e.g., phishing, malware) used in breaches.  
   * **Data Compromised:** Categorize the types of data compromised (e.g., personal, financial, healthcare).  
3. **Response and Recovery:**  
   * **Response Times:** Track the average time taken to detect, respond to, and recover from breaches.  
   * **Effectiveness of Response:** Assess the effectiveness of different response strategies and their impact on minimizing damage.  
4. **Vulnerability Analysis:**  
   * **Common Vulnerabilities:** Identify common vulnerabilities exploited in breaches.  
   * **Patch Management:** Analyze the effectiveness of patch management processes and their correlation with breach incidents.  
5. **Geographic and Sector Analysis:**  
   * **Geographic Distribution:** Map the geographic distribution of breaches to identify regions with higher incident rates.  
   * **Sector-Specific Insights:** Compare breach data across different sectors (e.g., finance, healthcare) to identify sector-specific risks and trends.  
6. **Predictive Analysis:**  
   * **Risk Scoring:** Develop predictive models to assess the risk of future breaches based on historical data.  
   * **Threat Forecasting:** Use machine learning to forecast potential future threats and vulnerabilities.

#### **Technology Stack**

* **Data Visualization Tools:**  
  * Tableau: For creating detailed, interactive dashboards and visualizations.  
  * Power BI: For designing comprehensive reports and real-time dashboards.  
* **Data Sources:**  
  * Data Breach Reports: Collect data from breach reports, security blogs, and public databases (e.g., Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, Breach Level Index).  
  * Incident Logs: Use internal incident logs and security monitoring tools.  
* **Data Processing:**  
  * ETL Tools (Optional): Use tools like Alteryx or Talend for data extraction, transformation, and loading.  
* **Machine Learning:**  
  * Python or R: For developing predictive models and analyzing patterns.

#### **Timeline**

* **Week 1-2:** Data Collection and Preparation  
  * Gather and clean data from breach reports and logs.  
  * Set up ETL processes if required.  
* **Week 3-4:** Dashboard Development  
  * Design and build Tableau dashboards focusing on incident overview and characteristics.  
  * Create Power BI reports for response and recovery analysis.  
* **Week 5-6:** Predictive Analysis and Refinement  
  * Develop predictive models using historical data.  
  * Refine dashboards based on initial findings and user feedback.  
* **Week 7:** Testing and Deployment  
  * Test dashboards with stakeholders.  
  * Deploy dashboards to Tableau Server/Online and Power BI Service.  
* **Week 8:** Documentation and Training  
  * Document dashboard features and provide user guides.  
  * Offer training sessions or resources for users.

#### **Deliverables**

* Interactive Tableau and Power BI dashboards analyzing data breach incidents.  
* Predictive models and risk scoring for future breach assessment.  
* Documentation and user guides for dashboards.  
* Training materials if applicable.

#### **Assumptions and Constraints**

* Access to comprehensive and up-to-date breach data.  
* Compatibility of data formats and integration tools.  
* Stakeholder feedback and adjustments may impact the timeline.

#### **Success Criteria**

* Dashboards provide actionable insights into breach patterns and response effectiveness.  
* Positive feedback from stakeholders regarding the usefulness and clarity of the dashboards.  
* Improved understanding of vulnerabilities and response strategies.
